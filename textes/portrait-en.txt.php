	Sophie likes illustrating subjects for the decorative arts press 
	(Figaro Madame, Idées magazine, Campagne Décoration)  creating 
	with her customers the ideal crockery, offering to the shops and 
	decorators exclusive collections (grass fairies,…) imagining 
	projects for public events (Lancome trophy, Milo…).

	From a few evening classes to the training courses in Limoges she asserts herself 
	as  a passionate by professionals and  private individuals. Sophie Masson 
	paints her porcelain to order : plates, coffee cups, trays…. She uses simple 
	shapes on which she declines her shades of colours with multiple hues. 
	Bayadere or plain, monochrome or with merging shades with a dragonfly or 
	else, finished with a thin gold or platinum line. Each piece is unique.

<div class="portrait">
	From her training as a designer and her visits to trend consulting agencies 
	Sophie Masson has mainly kept the taste for colour. Sophie has nothing to 
	do with the artist that keeps on writing notes on her sketch book she just 
	records images. The right time, after having gone through the filter of her 
	sensibility and trends outlines and colours shape up. Porcelain painting 
	has rapidly appeared  as the best territory to express her talent.
